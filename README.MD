# BIN PACKING LOWER, UPPER BOUND

## Problem description

There exist N customers 1, 2,..., N where customer `i` ordered `d[i]` quantity of goods with the total value of `c[i]`. There are K trucks 1, 2,..., K transfering goods where truck `k` has a minimum load of `c1[k]` and maximum load of `c2[k]`. Compute the tranfering plan sastifying:

- Each customer takes goods from only 1 truck.
- The total amount of goods on each truck must be in the range of the minimum and maximum loads of it.
- The total values of delivered goods must be maximized.
